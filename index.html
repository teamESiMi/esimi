				<h1 class="section-title">about</h1>
				<p class="about__content">My interest in becoming a doula began when I first encountered a neonatal ultrasound. Since then, I have been amazed by the power of the female body and its ability to grow, nourish, and birth a miracle. I am grateful for the opportunity to partner with expecting moms as they prepare for one of life's biggest adventures. As a doula, my purpose is to educate and empower women for the birth they desire. Education has been a passion of mine for years. I began as a first grade teacher in Maryland, but soon realized I was more passionate about teaching (and learning from!) moms-to-be about the journey of childbirth. My degree in education from University of Maryland has equipped me with helpful techniques and principles that have translated into educating others about empowered births.In November 2016, I married my high school sweetheart. We enjoy spending time outdoors, visiting animal shelters, and discovering new places to eat. We are thrilled to call Austin, TX home!</p>

						<span class="faq__question">What is a doula?</span>
					</div>
					<faq class="faq__a">
						<span class="faq__letter">A:</span>
						<span class="faq__answer">As a doula, my job is often referred to as "mothering the mother". I provide physical, emotional, and educational support for a birthing woman before and during labor, as well as postpartum.</span>
					</faq>
				</div>


				<div class="faq__qa">
					<div class="faq__q">
						<span class="faq__letter">Q:</span>
						<span class="faq__question">My partner will be with me the whole time. Would we benefit from a doula?</span>
					</div>
					<faq class="faq__a">
						<span class="faq__letter">A:</span>
						<span class="faq__answer">You may have heard of the term 'birth team'; A birth team works together to care for a mother and her needs during the exhausting journey of labor. As a doula, I am trained in ways to comfort a birthing woman, and naturally encourage descent of your baby. Because your partner knows you best, we will work together to support your physical and emotional needs. I will deliver my support in the way that best fits your family's needs - whether your partner chooses to fully be hands-on, or prefers to offer moral and emotional support, I will conform to your dynamic.</span>
					</faq>
				</div>

				<div class="faq__qa">
					<div class="faq__q">
						<span class="faq__letter">Q:</span>
						<span class="faq__question">Does a doula provide support during cesarean births?</span>
					</div>
					<faq class="faq__a">
						<span class="faq__letter">A:</span>
						<span class="faq__answer">Absolutely! A cesarean birth can be frightening, especially if you weren't originally planning for one. If allowed by your care provider, I will be by your side throughout the entire procedure! Too often, mothers feel separated from the experience of a cesarean birth; but with a doula, you are not alone! I will make sure you're included in the experience and are informed of each step of the birth of your baby, with sensitivity to your comfort level during the process. I will assist you in holding and meeting your new baby as your care provider finishes the cesarean procedure. I can also take pictures the moment you and your spouse meet your baby for the first time, if you would like. In the case that your baby has to be relocated, I will continue to stay by your side, while your partner follows your baby, so neither of you are alone. If you're having a cesarean birth, we can discuss your wishes and the options of a family centered cesarean at your birth location!</span>

					</div>
					<faq class="faq__a">
						<span class="faq__letter">A:</span>
						<span class="faq__answer">Of course! I will support you and your unique birth in any setting. As January Harshe states, "I do not care what kind of birth you have... a homebirth, scheduled cesarean, epidural hospital birth, or if you birth alone in the woods next to baby deer. I care that you had options, that you were supported in your choices, and that you were respected".</span>

						<span class="faq__question">How does a doula differ from a midwife?</span>
					</div>
					<faq class="faq__a">
						<span class="faq__letter">A:</span>
						<span class="faq__answer">A midwife performs clinical and medical tasks, whereas a doula coaches you through labor and birth. As a doula, I do not perform vaginal exams, administer medication, or provide medical diagnosis or advice. However, I will be by your side at all times, whereas a midwife may not be able to be fully present until the later stages of labor.</span>

						<span class="faq__question">What training and experience do you have?</span>
					</div>
					<faq class="faq__a">
						<span class="faq__letter">A:</span>
						<span class="faq__answer">I began my birth doula certification through DONA International in June 2016. This comprehensive training involves a 12-hour childbirth class, 3-hour breastfeeding course, 16-hour birth doula workshop, and hands-on experience as a birth doula for a minimum of 3 births. Exceptional evaluations from the mother herself, and her care provider are required, along with proof of extensive reading on pregnancy, labor support, breastfeeding, and postpartum mood disorders. While pursuing my certification, I continue to seek opportunities to learn and gain experience in the birth world. I began volunteering for GALS (Giving Austin Labor Support) in September 2016 as a birth doula and dispatch operator. I also enjoy attending community birth events and workshops to be able to share my experiences with Mamas. A few of my favorites include use of essential oils and placenta encapsulation!</span>

						<span class="faq__answer">Yes! I serve clients in Austin and it's surrounding areas - as far North as Round Rock and Cedar Park, and as far South as Kyle, TX. However, special cases do apply, so don't be afraid to ask. Contact me for more information!</span>
